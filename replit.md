# MathTunis - Educational Math Assistant

## Overview

MathTunis is an AI-powered educational platform designed for Tunisian students from middle school to high school (baccalaur√©at). The application provides an intelligent chatbot that can solve mathematical problems using multiple input methods (text, image, PDF, audio) and supports multiple languages (French, Arabic, Tunisian dialect). The platform offers 2 free questions for anonymous users and unlimited access for registered users.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with a clear separation between client and server components:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state, React hooks for local state
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Design**: RESTful API with structured route handling
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Primary Auth**: Firebase Authentication for user management
- **Backend Integration**: Custom user storage with Firebase UID mapping
- **User Types**: Regular users and admin users with role-based access

### Database Layer
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless integration (ACTIVE)
- **Schema**: Comprehensive schema covering users, conversations, messages, math solutions, and admin content
- **Migration**: Drizzle Kit for schema management
- **Storage**: DatabaseStorage class providing full CRUD operations for all entities
- **Connection**: Configured with DATABASE_URL environment variable and connection pooling

### AI Math Solver
- **Primary Engine**: HuggingFace Transformers API
- **Fallback Strategy**: Web scraping from mathematical websites (Wolfram Alpha, Mathway, Symbolab)
- **Input Processing**: Multiple format support (text, images via Tesseract.js, PDF via pdf.js, audio via Web Speech API)
- **Language Support**: French, Arabic, and Tunisian dialect processing

### UI/UX Components
- **Design System**: shadcn/ui components with custom theming
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with desktop optimization
- **Accessibility**: ARIA compliant components from Radix UI
- **Interactive Elements**: Real-time chat interface, file upload, audio recording

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Firebase handles initial auth, backend validates and stores user data
2. **Question Submission**: Multiple input modes process user questions into standardized text format
3. **AI Processing**: Questions are sent to HuggingFace models, with fallback to web scraping if needed
4. **Response Generation**: Structured math solutions with step-by-step explanations
5. **Storage**: All conversations and solutions are persisted in PostgreSQL
6. **Real-time Updates**: React Query manages cache invalidation and real-time UI updates

## External Dependencies

### Required Services
- **Neon Database**: PostgreSQL hosting (configured via DATABASE_URL)
- **Firebase**: Authentication and user management
- **HuggingFace**: AI model API for math problem solving

### Optional Integrations
- **Web Scraping**: Puppeteer/Playwright for fallback math solutions
- **File Processing**: Browser-native APIs for image, PDF, and audio processing
- **Replit**: Development environment integration with hot reload and error overlay

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Hot Reload**: Vite development server with React Fast Refresh
- **Database**: Drizzle schema push for rapid development
- **Environment**: Node.js with tsx for TypeScript execution

### Production
- **Build Process**: Vite for frontend bundling, esbuild for backend compilation
- **Static Assets**: Served from dist/public directory
- **Server**: Express.js serving both API and static content
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling via Neon serverless
- **Data Persistence**: Full database integration with user accounts, conversations, messages, math solutions, and admin content

## Recent Changes

### 2025-01-29: Database Integration Complete
- **Added PostgreSQL database** with Neon serverless connection
- **Implemented DatabaseStorage** replacing in-memory storage for full persistence
- **Configured database schema** with users, conversations, messages, math_solutions, and admin_content tables
- **Tested database operations** - user registration, conversation creation, message persistence all working
- **Updated storage system** to use Drizzle ORM with proper error handling and type safety

### Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Firebase config, database URL, HuggingFace API key
- **TypeScript**: Shared types between client and server via shared directory
- **Path Aliases**: Configured for clean imports (@/, @shared/, @assets/)

The architecture prioritizes developer experience with TypeScript throughout, modern tooling, and a clear separation of concerns while maintaining the flexibility to add features like advanced AI models or additional input processing capabilities.
